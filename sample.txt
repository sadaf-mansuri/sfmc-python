Subject: Data Requirement for SMS Link Click Analysis

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope you're doing well. We are currently working on the analytics of visible campaign data and have identified a need for some additional data that may not be available in BigQuery. Specifically, we require data from the _SMSMessageTracking and _Click tables in Salesforce Marketing Cloud to perform analysis on link clicks sent via SMS.

Please let me know if we need to schedule a call with the team to discuss this further. I'd be happy to coordinate a time that works for everyone.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
